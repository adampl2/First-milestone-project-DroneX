# FIRST MILESTONE PROJECT DRONEX

## Description 

#### The goal of this project is to create a fictional drone delivery service website. Here businesses can cooperate with us to use our company drones and revolutionise their delivery service. The goal of this website is to give  our users a clear understanding of what our service is and what it does. My goal is to generate as many new clients as possible for our service.

#### HTML and CSS were used for this project as well as Bootsrap framework to provide the website with responsive and mobile-first design.
